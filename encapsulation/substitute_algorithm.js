// Sometimes, when I want to change the algorithm to work slightly differently, itâ€™s easier to start by replacing it with something that would make my change more straightforward to make.

// Decompose the method as much as you can. Replacing a large, complex algorithm is very difficult; only by making it simple can I make the substitution tractable.
