// If dead code can be referenced from outside, e.g. when it's a full function, search for callers
// Remove any dead code

// Unused code is a significant burden when trying to understand how software works. It doesn't tell programmers that they can ignore this function

// Once code isn't used, we should delete it. If I may need it in the future, we can use our version control system (git) to git it out again. I can also add a comment into the code that mentions the lost code and the revision (commit) that removed it
